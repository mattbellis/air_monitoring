# Week 1 (5/21/2018-5/25/2018)

**Lauren's Notes** 
*   *Day Numero Uno*:

       +  I learned what exactly an arudino is as well as the parts to an arduino
       +  I was issued an arduino (well Adadfruit Metro but basically the same thing), breadboard, a box LED's, a box of resistors and a box of wires
       +  I learned to wire the Adafruit and breadboard so an LED would blink
       + Basically an intro to what we are doing as well as getting familiar with our work space
        
*     *Day Numero Dos*:
         + I spent time learning how to wire the circuit for multiple LED's
         + That took me literally all day to figure out because of software issues on the computer
              ++ I purchased an adapter due to my computer being a Macbook Pro Sierra version 10.13.4 therefore it does not have a normal USB port. It was a USB-C to USB adapter cable by Apple, bought from Best Buy for $20.52
         + Turns out it was actually just my security settings, eventually got the lights blinking
         + I was issued a pitot tube, pitot tube measures Voltage but we need it to measure air pressure
               ++ How are we going to go about this...?
         + We need to know total mass of air that flows through the tube
                ++ Volts to pressure?
                ++ 1024 reading = 5V (analog)
                
*       *Day Numero Tres*:
           + We will be spending time logging information as well as testing the pitot tube
           + I personally need to figure out how to connect the tube, I have been reading links and stuff about the tubes
